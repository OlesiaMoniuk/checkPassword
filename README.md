#Task:
Create applications to test password strength.

The essence of the assignment:
- Create a field for entering a password, under the field add 3 sections which will show the strength of the password;
- Changes in password strength must take place in real time;
- How to calculate the strength of a password:
1) Only letters/digits/symbols - the password is easy;
2) Combination of letters-symbols/letters-digits/digits-symbols - the password is medium;
3) Has letters, symbols and numbers - the password is strong;
- The color of the sections will depend on the strength of the password:
1) If the field is empty, all sections are gray;
2) If the field has less than 8 characters, all sections are red;
3) If the password is easy - the first section is red the rest are gray;
4) If the password is medium - the first two sections are yellow the last one is gray;
5) If the password is strong, all sections are green;
